# Vibe DevOps

Vision: Create a seamless bridge between business requirements and cloud infrastructure, enabling users to deploy complex applications on GCP using only natural language and their existing code

Mission: Serve as an intelligent, conversational "Cloud Architect" that plans, builds, and visualizes GCP infrastructure, abstracting away all technical complexity from the user.

- agentic tool that interprets a scenario and automatically configures complex cloud environments

- Competitive differentiation: full execution, full end-to-end flow, human oversight + rollback could be a killer feature.

- Spec ingestion → pre-processing/parsing → plan generation → route generation → validation/safety checks → Human in the loop (HITL) → Permissions → Infra provisioning → Monitoring → Post-execution validation → Dashboard updates

Assumptions include:

- It’s feasible to parse specs well enough to map to infra actions without gaps.

- permissions / safety / governance issues can be solved.

- Agents can be trusted to take actions not just propose them.

- There is demand / market for end-to-end actionable automation

Pre-Requisites

- Core pillars:

- Terraform documentation

- Google Cloud Architecture

Questions:

- How could you build such a system with strong safety, auditing, rollback, least-privilege, to satisfy enterprise security/compliance constraints?

- What is the minimal version of this product that demonstrates value (e.g. generating Terraform + dry-running) so that you minimize risk before you allow full “act” mode?

- What UI/UX, feedback loops, or human-in-the-loop design must be included so the user trusts the system enough to allow full execution rather than just suggestions?

- Like how CI/CD took over builds, can this idea be thought of as “Continuous Infrastructure through Natural Language + Agents” — what was required historically for CI/CD to become mainstream, and how to replicate that path?

- [Pranav] what agentic frameworks to use with pov to general python applications? Google ADK would probably be the best framework to work with google services, but is it built to be integrated into full-stack application code? is this framework fully production ready? if not, which framework is our best bet for this application? can we do one framework for software engg, and google adk for handling google services interaction?

Weaknesses / Risks

1. Safety / security risks: Bad infra changes can break things, incur cost, cause outages. Needs robust checks.

1. Permissions / IAM complexity: The system needs rights, but granting too many is bad. Fine-grained control might be hard.

1. Spec ambiguity / natural language parsing: Specs are often incomplete, ambiguous; wrong interpretation can have big consequences.

1. State management / drift / conflict with existing infra: The system needs to understand existing resources, current state.

What Would Make the Product Strong/Better

- Human-in-the-loop mode for high risk actions; allow preview, plan, review, then apply.

- Strong versioning, IaC + state tracking + drift detection.

- Permissions/IAM least privilege model; possibly use temporary credentials / limited scopes.

- Audit trails, rollback, testing in staging first.

- Good UI/UX for spec docs → plan review.

- Focus initially on a narrow subset of GCP services (networking, VPCs, security groups, EC2, maybe serverless) to reduce scope, iterate.

- Ability to integrate with existing IaC (Terraform, CDK, etc.) rather than create entirely new infra definition.

Technical Feasibility

7/10

Parsers + IaC + agent workflows are possible; 

building robust execution, safety & drift detection is harder

- knowledge graph

- state

Market Demand

8/10

Strong need, especially in cloud operations, DevOps teams, SMEs with less infra expertise.

API / Backend Service Layer: Exposes endpoints that coordinate between agents, orchestrator, tools; handles authentication, authorization; orchestrates flows.

Agent Orchestrator: The “brain” that takes a spec/text → planning agent(s) → execution paths, coordinating specialist agents. 

Planning Agent: Parses the spec/text; does extraction of requirements; converts into an action plan / TODO list. Might produce multiple options with pros/cons.

Review / HITL Module: A place where plan is human-reviewable; human approves/adjusts

Execution Agent: Takes an approved plan; orchestrates applying changes to GCP. Could use Terraform

## Detailed Flow / Steps

Spec Ingestion

- User provides input: plain English spec, spec doc (Markdown, text, maybe PDF), or existing IaC or templates.

- Backend stores input, versions it

Pre-processing / Parsing

- Clean up document (strip markup if needed).

- Use NLP / prompt / LLM to extract entities: what GCP resources are needed, constraints (e.g. availability zones, region, cost, security constraints), dependencies.
