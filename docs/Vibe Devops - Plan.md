## Core Features to Build

Phase 1: Read-Only Intelligence (Minimal Viable Product)

- Start with features that analyze and plan without executing. 

- This phase proves your parsing and planning capabilities without the risk of actual deployment.

Phase 2: Dry-Run and Preview Mode

Add the ability to validate plans against actual GCP environments. This means implementing drift detection to compare plans against existing infrastructure, policy validation against organization constraints, a dependency analyzer ensuring resources are created in the right order, and change impact analysis showing what would be modified. Think of this as your "git diff" for infrastructure.
